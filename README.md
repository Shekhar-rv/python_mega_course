# python_mega_course

This is a course I started on Udemy to learn Python. I am using this repository to store my code as I go through the course. I have added a requirements.txt file to the repository so that I can install the packages I need for the course. I am using a virtual environment to install the packages. I am using the following command to install the packages:

```bash
make init
```
