# python_mega_course

This is a course I started on Udemy to learn Python. I am using this repository to store my code as I go through the course. I have added a requirements.txt file to the repository so that I can install the packages I need for the course. I am using a virtual environment to install the packages. I am using the following command to install the packages:

```bash
make init
```

### Project 1: Folium Maps

This project is to create a map using the folium package. I have created two maps, one is a basic one of Sheffield with two markers showing the location of the University of Sheffield and the location of the Sheffield Hallam University. The second map is a choropleth map of world based on the population of each country and a circular marker showing the location of different volcanoes in the USA.
